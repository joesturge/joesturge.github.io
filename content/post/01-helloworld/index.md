# Welcome

This is hopefully the first of many posts I put on this site. Welcome aboard! I'm Joe and I'm a software engineer.

## Purpose

The purpose of this blog is to document any interesting (or not) things I happen upon, and write them down so I don't forget. If any of my content just so happens to help anyone else in their endeavours then that is a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

## What to Expect

You can expect a mix of:
- Things I've learned the hard way
- Projects I'm tinkering with
- Random technical discoveries
- Other...
